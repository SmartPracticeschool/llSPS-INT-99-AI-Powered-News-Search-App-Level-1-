  **INTRODUCTION:**  
The web is home to massive amounts of data, with more being created every day. Organizations can harness this constant stream of information to gain understanding, plan strategies, and find opportunities. Enriched news data can help your application make dynamic connections across current events faster.

All we need to do is give relevant keywords regarding the required news to the chatbot so that it can fetch the news articles and links.  This app also determines the sentiment of the article.
Software Designing:
In order to build this app, the following things are need to be done:
1. Build a Server Side Application using Node-RED.
2. Use the pre-built Watson Discovery News collection.
3. Access the Watson Discovery Service through the Discovery API.
4. Use a Slack interface to query the data.
5. Push news alerts out to web notification.
6. Deploy the app on IBM Cloud.

**APPLICATIONS:**    
-Can be used by companies that involve following the latest news.  
-Can be used in stock market predictions.  
-Can be used by anyone all around the world to get fast and accurate results.
